            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Mines! If you are new to this exciting grid-based game from Spribe, you have come to the right place. This beginner's guide will walk you through everything you need to know to start playing Mines with confidence.</p>

            <p>Mines is one of the simplest casino games to learn, drawing inspiration from the classic Minesweeper computer game. However, unlike Minesweeper, there is no logic puzzle to solve. Instead, it is a game of chance where you reveal tiles hoping to find gems while avoiding hidden mines.</p>

            <p>By the end of this guide, you will understand how to place bets, choose your risk level, reveal tiles, and most importantly, when to cash out. For a deeper understanding of the game's mechanics, check out our <a href="/what-is-mines/">What is Mines?</a> comprehensive guide.</p>

        <section id="step-by-step">
            <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
            <p>Here is how to play Mines from start to finish:</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Set Your Bet Amount</h3>
            <p>Before starting a round, decide how much you want to wager.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the +/- buttons or input field to set your bet</li>
                <li>Most platforms offer minimum and maximum bet limits</li>
                <li>Start small while learning the game</li>
                <li>Never bet more than you can afford to lose</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Choose Your Mine Count</h3>
            <p>Select how many mines will be hidden on the grid (1-24).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fewer mines (1-5):</strong> Safer, smaller multipliers</li>
                <li><strong>Medium mines (6-12):</strong> Balanced risk and reward</li>
                <li><strong>More mines (13-24):</strong> Riskier, larger multipliers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Beginners should start with 3-5 mines to get comfortable with the game.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Start the Round</h3>
            <p>Click on any tile on the grid to begin. Your bet is placed when you make your first click.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Reveal Tiles</h3>
            <p>Click on tiles one at a time. Each click reveals either:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gem (Star):</strong> You are safe! Your multiplier increases</li>
                <li><strong>Mine:</strong> Game over, you lose your bet</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 5: Decide: Cash Out or Continue</h3>
            <p>After each gem, you have a choice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cash Out:</strong> Collect your current winnings (bet x multiplier)</li>
                <li><strong>Continue:</strong> Click another tile to increase your multiplier</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 6: Round Ends</h3>
            <p>The round ends when you either:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cash out (you win your bet times the multiplier)</li>
                <li>Hit a mine (you lose your bet)</li>
                <li>Reveal all gems (automatic cash out at maximum multiplier)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>During Gameplay</h2>
            <p>Once the round starts, here is what happens and what to consider:</p>

            <h3>Your First Click</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Click any tile on the grid</li>
                <li>Position does not matter since mine placement is random</li>
                <li>Do not overthink which tile to click</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>After Finding a Gem</h3>
            <p>When you reveal a gem:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your multiplier increases</li>
                <li>The "Cash Out" button becomes active</li>
                <li>You can see your potential winnings</li>
                <li>The probability of the next click changes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tracking Your Progress</h3>
            <p>Pay attention to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Current Multiplier:</strong> What you would get if you cash out now</li>
                <li><strong>Gems Revealed:</strong> How many safe tiles you have found</li>
                <li><strong>Remaining Tiles:</strong> How many choices remain</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Tension Builds</h3>
            <p>As you reveal more gems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multipliers grow faster</li>
                <li>But the probability of hitting a mine may increase</li>
                <li>The psychological pressure to cash out intensifies</li>
                <li>This is where discipline matters most</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="cash-out">
            <h2>When to Cash Out</h2>
            <p>The cash out decision is the most important aspect of playing Mines.</p>

            <h3>Cash Out Strategies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fixed Target:</strong> Set a multiplier goal before starting (e.g., cash out at 2x)</li>
                <li><strong>Fixed Gems:</strong> Decide how many gems to reveal before cashing out</li>
                <li><strong>Gut Feeling:</strong> Less recommended, as emotions can lead to poor decisions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Factors to Consider</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Current multiplier vs. probability of next gem</li>
                <li>Your session goals and profit targets</li>
                <li>Your remaining bankroll</li>
                <li>Whether you have reached your win goal</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Mathematics of Cashing Out</h3>
            <p>From a purely mathematical standpoint:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The expected value is the same whenever you cash out</li>
                <li>The house edge is built into every multiplier</li>
                <li>There is no "optimal" cash out point mathematically</li>
                <li>Your decision should be based on your risk tolerance and bankroll</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Common Cash Out Mistakes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Getting Greedy:</strong> Pushing too far and losing everything</li>
                <li><strong>Cashing Out Too Early:</strong> Never building meaningful multipliers</li>
                <li><strong>Inconsistency:</strong> Changing strategy mid-session based on emotions</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="auto-features">
            <h2>Auto-Play Features</h2>
            <p>Some Mines platforms offer auto-play features. Here is what you need to know:</p>

            <h3>Random Reveal</h3>
            <p>Some versions offer a button that randomly reveals a tile for you.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Does not change your odds</li>
                <li>Removes decision-making from tile selection</li>
                <li>Convenient but also removes some engagement</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Auto Cash Out</h3>
            <p>Set a multiplier target and the game automatically cashes out when reached.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Removes temptation to continue past your target</li>
                <li>Helps maintain discipline</li>
                <li>Can be a responsible gambling tool</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Auto Bet</h3>
            <p>Some platforms allow automated betting rounds.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Warning:</strong> This can lead to rapid bankroll depletion</li>
                <li>Not recommended for beginners</li>
                <li>If used, set strict limits</li>
                <li>Monitor your balance frequently</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Caution with Auto Features</h3>
            <p>Automated features can make it easier to lose track of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How much you have wagered</li>
                <li>How much you have lost</li>
                <li>How long you have been playing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Always maintain awareness of your gambling activity.</p>

        <section id="common-mistakes">
            <h2>Common Beginner Mistakes</h2>
            <p>Avoid these typical errors that new players make:</p>

            <h3>Mistake 1: Starting with High Mine Counts</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> The allure of big multipliers is tempting.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it is wrong:</strong> You will lose most rounds, depleting your bankroll before understanding the game.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Start with 3-5 mines until you are comfortable.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 2: Betting Too Large</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Excitement or desire to win big quickly.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it is wrong:</strong> Large bets with gambling variance can wipe out your bankroll fast.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Bet 1-2% of your session bankroll per round.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 3: Chasing Losses</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Emotional reaction to losing streaks.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it is wrong:</strong> Increasing bets after losses accelerates losses.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Stick to your predetermined bet size regardless of results.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 4: No Cash Out Plan</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Not thinking ahead before starting.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it is wrong:</strong> In-the-moment decisions are often emotional and poor.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Decide your cash out target before each round.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 5: Playing Without Limits</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Getting caught up in the excitement.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it is wrong:</strong> Can lead to significant financial and emotional harm.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Set time and money limits before playing.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 6: Believing in Patterns</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Human brains seek patterns everywhere.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it is wrong:</strong> Each round is completely random and independent.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Accept that past results do not predict future outcomes.</p>

            <p>Before playing with real money, consider these practice suggestions:</p>

            </ul>

            <h3>Start Small</h3>
            <p>When transitioning to real money:</p>

            </ul>

                <li>"I will not increase my bet after a loss"</li>
                <li>"I will stop after my predetermined time limit"</li>
